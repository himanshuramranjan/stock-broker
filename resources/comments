> Design modification

This design implements in depth implementation of trade matching scenarios (trying to mimic the real time to
some extent),  there can be a simpler version without the MatchingEngine, where we directly buy and sell the stock
from the Exchange

> Flow of the app

Investor → Broker → StockExchange → OrderProcessor
            ↓                      ↓
         (placeOrder)          MatchingEngine → (findMatch)
                                    ↓
                      match found? Yes → OrderProcessor → executeTrade
                                      → update balances, portfolios
                             No  → OrderBook → store for future match

> Why there is no stockVsQuantity mapping at the StockExchange

In real world there is no fixed quantity on a exchange its the concurrent
buying and selling which makes the volume keep going.

So instead, have implemented stockVsPrice (mocked price as fixed, as we are not simulating
any real buy sell txn)

> To mimic the exact multi leg txn (where one buy order can be fulfilled with multiple sell order and vice-versa)

Conceptual Changes Needed:
1. Support Partial Fill in Orders
Add remainingQuantity or filledQuantity in Order

Update it as each match happens

Track OrderStatus: PARTIALLY_EXECUTED, EXECUTED, PENDING

2. MatchingEngine Loop
Instead of stopping at first match, keep polling the sell orders as long as:

sell.price <= buy.price

remainingQuantity > 0

Match as much as possible in each round

3. Execute Trades in Multiple Legs
Each matched leg is an individual trade

Update both buyer/seller portfolio & balance proportionally

4. Leave Remaining Orders Back in Book
Unmatched portion of sell order (like S2’s remaining 5 shares) is kept in book

Unmatched buy quantity (if any) may also remain or be cancelled


> Also we can add the validity for which current order should be valid (like for a day or month)

> In portfolio the map can be of Map<String, StockHolding>
where each holding stands for the individual buy (with explicit price,
qty and time) to get a detailed view of the holdings
